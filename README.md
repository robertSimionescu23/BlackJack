# BlackJack
 A work in progress Black Jack game .
 I still have to add the split mechanics, at a later date .
 I am looking to improve performance, and make an interface for it in the future .
 I will simplify the code as i get better a Java .
 
 
 To Do:
 -Split hand mechanic
 
 -Remove and restructure
 
 -A basic SQL database as a side project
 
 -A front end interface
